# Joint_System_Relaxometry_JSR
Matlab code to compute relaxometry measurements using the JSR approach

This code has been developped with the interest of computational speed and might not be easily comprehensible. A more comprehensive version can be provided on request.

# Usage
This code can be executed as is. Example generation of signal, its jacobian and a small monte carlo simulation can be found by running testCode.m
